        "OOP Concepts Used:\n"
        "- Encapsulation: Each model and GUI component is wrapped in its own class.\n"
        "- Polymorphism: Different model handlers implement the same interface (run method).\n"
        "- Method Overriding: Subclasses override the base run method to customize behavior.\n"
        "- Multiple Inheritance: GUI class inherits from both Tkinter and custom base class.\n"
        "- Multiple Decorators: Can be added to model methods for logging, error handling, etc."
